# How to Host and Format a Resume by Software Stack
## Purpose
A README file includes important information, instructions, helps, or details for users about the software, code, or project.  
In this case, the README file will teach CS students how to host and format a resume by Markdown, Jekyll, and Github Pages. Meanwhile, the README file will also introduce the general principles of technical writing that included in Andrew Etter's book.

## Instructions
### Build your own .md file
Andrew Etter suggests that a lightweight markup language is a better choice than XML for programmers. As a result, Markdown can be the good choice for a new programmer who need a lightwegith markup language. Markdown is easy to learn and use with a bunch of good online examples, and these characteristics can answer why Markdown is used so widely in the world. Now, let's start doing your first resume file in Markdown.

1. Open a Markdown editor (for OS or online)
2. Type relative words about your resume in right syntax of Markdown
3. Save the file in ".md" format
4. Change the file to "index.md" (recommended for building online resume web page in the future)

After the above steps, you have a resume in Markdown.

### Create a repository in your Github
For developers, a durable strategy for storing and updating documentations and works is the most significant issue that they need to consider. It's not safe to store and update all works in local personal computers. If personal computers have unpredictable issues and errors, developers may lose all their works that they are processing. Meanwhile, if a project will be done by several developers, it's difficult to synchronize all progress of different developers in traditional way. So, the distributed version control system (DVCS) was created to handle this task.
